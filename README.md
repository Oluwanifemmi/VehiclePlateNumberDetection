Plate Detection Model
This repository contains a plate detection model that utilizes the "inception_resnet" pre-trained model for accurate object detection. The model is designed to detect license plates in images and extract the text from them using OpenCV and Pytesseract.

Data Source
The dataset used for training and testing the plate detection model was obtained from Kaggle. It includes a collection of images with annotated license plates, which served as the basis for training the model.

Model Selection
After experimenting with different approaches, the "inception_resnet" pre-trained model was chosen over "YOLO" due to its superior accuracy in object detection, particularly for license plates. The "inception_resnet" architecture combines both inception modules and residual connections, making it effective for complex image recognition tasks like plate detection.

Training Process
The model was trained on the Kaggle dataset using transfer learning. By leveraging the "inception_resnet" pre-trained weights, the model achieved faster convergence and better performance. Training was performed on a GPU to expedite the process and enhance efficiency.

Test Data
To evaluate the model's performance, a separate dataset was obtained from Kaggle, containing images with license plates not present in the training set. This unseen data was used to measure the model's generalization and ability to handle real-world scenarios.

Plate Extraction and Text Recognition
Once the model identifies a potential license plate in an image, it uses OpenCV to extract the region of interest (ROI) containing the plate. This process helps to isolate the plate and discard irrelevant information, enhancing the accuracy of text recognition.

Subsequently, the extracted ROI is passed to Pytesseract, an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tool, for text recognition. Pytesseract processes the image and extracts the text present on the license plate, providing us with the final output of the plate detection model.

How to Use
To utilize the plate detection model, follow the steps below:

Clone this repository to your local machine using the provided GitHub URL.
